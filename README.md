# Objective
- In this assignment, we're going to develop practical proficiency in Python programming, meaning on the manipulation of bipartite graphs.
- We need to have a good understanding of the market-clearing algorithm because we need to run a specific command.

# Requirement 
- This is the command to execute the Python script market_strategy.py located in the current directory that reads this file market.gml.
- Here, market.gml will be used for the analysis and the format is Graph Modeling Language (.gml) which describes the graph's structure with attributes.
